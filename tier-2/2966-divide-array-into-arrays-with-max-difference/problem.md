# 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Array, Greedy, Sorting

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` where `n` is a multiple of 3, and a positive integer `k`.

Divide the array `nums` into `n / 3` arrays of size 3 satisfying the following condition:

- The difference between **any** two elements in one array is less than or equal to `k`.

Return a **2D array** containing the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,4,2,2,5,2], k = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,4,5]]
```

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `n` is a multiple of 3.
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
